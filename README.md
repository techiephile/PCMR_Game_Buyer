# PCMR_Game_Buyer

--- About this ---

My goal for this script was to make a quick program to assist me when searching for video games across different stores. I came up with this script that will take a search term and enter it into different game store sites and open them in browser windows so you can choose the one with the best price. 

Stores it will search: 
Steam
Origin
G2A
Gog
Greenman Gaming
Kinguin

(let me know if I should add any!)

--- Usage ---

Simply download the main.py script and run it with python 2.7.


You can also download the exe file that was made using py2exe.

Here is a guide on how to make it yourself if you don't trust mine. (No offense taken.)
