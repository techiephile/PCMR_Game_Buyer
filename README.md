# PCMR_Game_Buyer

--- About this ---
My goal for this script was to make a quick script to assist me when buying games.

When run the script will take a search term that you give it and enter it into 6 different online PC game stores. It will open each store in a browser tab with your search term already entered, thus allowing you to compare prices and save some sweet cash. 

--- Usage ---

Simply download the main.py script and run it with python 3.

--- Disclaimer ---

I am not a programmer by trade. If you would like to improve on this script please have at it.
